### Just run create-reg.bat and then run Squarize-install.

It will add this script to the right-click menu, so when you open a PNG or JPG directly through it, you can squarize it.

If you already have a Python environment, you can just change the reg file and link the ICO and Python files I provided in GetEXE accordingly. 
I used Nuitka to compile and squeeze the size of the EXE by about 30% for my program, but it's still got a ridiculous size. 
Well, we all know why — Python's structure still doesn't support squeezing the package down to just grab the useful parts. 
Maybe in the near future, AI will help us with that, lmao.

Btw, I love SVGs, but I don't think that when you create a fantastic SVG with code, you’d still need to square it manually.
This staff is really just meant for dealing with those Unpleasant photos from casual recordings like the oscilloscope screen captures done by phone.

It's definitely not the best solution, but it works.
